## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used nested flex containers to achieve the layout for this challenge. The body is set to `display: flex` in order to center all of the content on the page. The `<div class="planInfo">` containing the music icon, pricing information, and change link is also a flex container and uses `justify-content: space-between` to align the information on the outside edges of the card. Finally, the `<div class="planPricing">` also uses flex to align the icon and pricing information. This challenge really helped me develop a deeper understanding of the various flex properties and how they can be used together to achive the desired layout. 

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a great resource for understanding flexbox, and it provides lots of code examples and illustrations.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - It's always a good idea to validate your HTML to check for errors, and this is a great tool you can use with a live site, uploaded file, or you can also paste your code in.
